# PyBer_Analysis

Performimg Analysis on a ride sharing company ("Pyber") data to uncover trends.

## Overview of the Analysis:

PyBer CEO needed a hand with Python and Pandas, a compilation was created with the data a DataFrame was made showing data by city type. With a dataframe, data was tapered to make essential analysis Also Pandas and Matplotlib were used, graph that shows the total weekly fares for Urban, Suburban, and Rural areas. With the analysis Pyber can pay better attention to areas that may need improving.

## Results:

For the analysis, a line graph & a chart was made to demostrate time on as a x variable, fare/income as a y variable, & the 3 areas, Urban, Suburban, and Rural.

The line graph shows the superiority of income by Urban areas, followed by Suburban areas with vast fluctuations with months, and finally rural areas with the least income.

Here is the DataFrame is similar to the line graph, but it conveys exact amount of weekly income/fares for the three areas in weekly intervals. Similarly to the line graph Urban on top in means of income/fares, Suburbs in second, and Rural lastly.


## Summary:

In conclusion, urban areas shows its strength based on the data. Suburbs does approximately half of the numbers of Urban. Rural does less than half of Suburbs. Based on the data Urban area may need majority of allocation of funds to service Pyber's "backbone" and, to a lesser extent Suburbs. Rural may seem dissmisive but, the information does not convey that growth or potential of the two smaller areas. More data must be collected to better understand the best path for allocation.
